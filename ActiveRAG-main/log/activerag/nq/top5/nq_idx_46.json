When entering a centrifugal pump, a low pressure forms at the eye of the impeller. Pre-rotation creates centrifugal forces that push the dense slurry towards the wall of the pipe while leaving a core of air at the center. According to Abulnaga (2004), the froth pump may use", "Document 4 (Title: Joule–Thomson effect): Joule–Thomson effect In thermodynamics, the Joule–Thomson effect (also known as the Joule–Kelvin effect, Kelvin–Joule effect) describes the temperature change of a \"real\" gas or liquid (as differentiated from an ideal gas) when it is forced through a valve or porous plug while keeping them insulated so that no heat is exchanged with the environment. This procedure is called a \"throttling process\" or \"Joule–Thomson process\". At room temperature, all gases except hydrogen, helium and neon cool upon expansion by the Joule–Thomson process when being throttled through an orifice; these three gases experience the same effect but only at lower temperatures. Some", "Document 5 (Title: Calcination): Calcination The IUPAC defines calcination as \"heating to high temperatures in air or oxygen\". However, calcination is also used to mean a thermal treatment process in the absence or limited supply of air or oxygen applied to ores and other solid materials to bring about a thermal decomposition. A calciner is a steel cylinder that rotates inside a heated furnace and performs indirect high-temperature processing (550–1150 °C, or 1000–2100 °F) within a controlled atmosphere. The process of calcination derives its name from the Latin \"calcinare\" (to burn lime) due to its most common application, the decomposition of calcium carbonate (limestone)"], "__answers__": ["pour point"]}}
