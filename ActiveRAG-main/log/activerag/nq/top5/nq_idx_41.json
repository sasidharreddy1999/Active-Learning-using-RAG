Therefore, the largest magnitude earthquake that has occurred in the Pacific Northwest region is the 1960 Chilean earthquake with a magnitude of 9.5.\n\nAnswer: The largest magnitude earthquake that has occurred in the Pacific Northwest is the 1960 Chilean earthquake with a magnitude of 9.5."}], "question_info": {"question": "what is the largest magnitude earthquake that has occurred in the pacific northwest", "passages": ["Document 1 (Title: 1993 Scotts Mills earthquake): 1993 Scotts Mills earthquake The 1993 Scotts Mills earthquake, also known as the \"Spring break quake\", occurred in the U.S. state of Oregon on March 25 at 5:34 AM Pacific Standard Time. With a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a maximum perceived intensity of VII (\"Very strong\") on the Mercalli intensity scale, it was the largest earthquake in the Pacific Northwest since the Elk Lake and Goat Rocks earthquakes of 1981. Ground motion was widely felt in Oregon's Willamette Valley, the Portland metropolitan area, and as far north as the Puget Sound area near Seattle, Washington. The Scotts Mills mainshock", "Document 2 (Title: 2008 Chino Hills earthquake): reports cited the Whittier fault as the active cause, but the quake was later determined to have been generated by the \"Yorba Linda trend,\" as identified by Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson. Its epicenter was within of Chino Hills and its hypocenter was c. deep. Initial estimations of the moderate main shock reported it as magnitude 5.8, but this was later revised to magnitude 5.4 and in later months to a 5.5. The main shock was reportedly felt as far south as San Diego, and Tijuana, Mexico, and as far east as Las Vegas, Nevada. It was the strongest earthquake to", "Document 3 (Title: Tsunami): in height when they reach shallower water, in a wave shoaling process described below. A tsunami can occur in any tidal state and even at low tide can still inundate coastal areas. On April 1, 1946, the 8.6 Aleutian Islands earthquake occurred with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (\"Strong\"). It generated a tsunami which inundated Hilo on the island of Hawaii with a surge. Between 165 and 173 were killed. The area where the earthquake occurred is where the Pacific Ocean floor is subducting (or being pushed downwards) under Alaska. Examples of tsunami originating at locations away from convergent", "Document 4 (Title: Earthquake): noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low-intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case. Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000 km long, horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the Pacific Plate. Massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries, too, such as along the", "Document 5 (Title: Earthquake): between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century. The 1960 Chilean earthquake is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph, reaching 9.5 magnitude on 22 May 1960. Its epicenter was near Cañete, Chile. The energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake, the Good Friday earthquake (March 27, 1964) which was centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska. The ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been megathrust earthquakes; however, of these ten, only the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history.
