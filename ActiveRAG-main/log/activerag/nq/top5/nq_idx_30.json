The electricity sector in New Zealand primarily uses renewable energy sources, making it one of the most sustainable economies in terms of energy generation.\n\nAnswer: Agriculture, forestry, and extractive industries\nBy considering the historical reliance on extractive industries, the significant contribution of agriculture and forestry to the economy, and the diverse nature of New Zealand's economy, it can be inferred that most of New Zealand's land supports agriculture, forestry, and extractive industries as primary economic activities."}], "question_info": {"question": "most of new zealands land supports which economic activity", "passages": ["Document 1 (Title: New Zealand): Economic Freedom. It is a high-income economy with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$36,254. The currency is the New Zealand dollar, informally known as the \"Kiwi dollar\"; it also circulates in the Cook Islands (see Cook Islands dollar), Niue, Tokelau, and the Pitcairn Islands. Historically, extractive industries have contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing at different times on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. The first shipment of refrigerated meat on the \"Dunedin\" in 1882 led to the establishment of meat and dairy exports to Britain, a trade which provided the basis", "Document 2 (Title: Economy of New Zealand): Economy of New Zealand The economy of New Zealand is the 53rd-largest national economy in the world when measured by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and the 68th-largest in the world when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). New Zealand has one of the most globalised economies and depends greatly on international trade â€“ mainly with Australia, the European Union, the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Canada. New Zealand's Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia means that the economy aligns closely with that of Australia.

Australia accounts for just over 25% of export value, mostly paper products, followed by Japan, South Korea, China and the United States. Within the New Zealand economy, forestry accounts for approximately 4% of national GDP. On the global stage, the New Zealand forestry industry is a relatively small contributor in terms of production, accounting for 1% of global wood supply for industrial purposes.

The electricity market is regulated by the Electricity Industry Participation Code administered by the Electricity Authority (EA). The electricity sector uses mainly renewable energy sources such as hydropower, geothermal power and increasingly wind energy. The 70% share of renewable energy sources makes New Zealand one of the most sustainable economies in terms of energy generation. New Zealand suffers from a geographical imbalance between electricity production and consumption. The most substantial electricity generation (both existing and as remaining potential) is located on the South Island and to a lesser degree"], "__answers__": ["agriculture", "Pastoral farming"]}}
