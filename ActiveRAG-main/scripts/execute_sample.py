    logician="Beowulf was most likely composed in the early 8th century, and its events probably take place in the 6th century. This timeline aligns with the historical context of the Anglo-Saxon migration to England and the Christianization of Scandinavia. The poem's depiction of a Germanic warrior society and its connections to Geatish origins further support this timeframe. By considering the historical events and cultural influences of the time, the model can make more accurate inferences about the relationships between characters and the societal norms depicted in Beowulf. Additionally, understanding the scholarly debates surrounding the poem's composition can help the model critically evaluate sources and consider multiple perspectives in its analysis."
